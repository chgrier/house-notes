House Notes
==========

My first major iOS App created at the University of California-San Diego Mobile Applications Development program .
Originally created in April 2013 for iOS 6 with minor revisions for iOS 7 in September 2013 .

The app was created to learn the basics of iOS development, including Core Location, Core Data, passing data, creating user interfaces and graphic asstets, and accessing the camera.

Please note this is an example of my first project in iOS -- I plan to do a more complete update for iOS 8 and publish the app when time allows.
